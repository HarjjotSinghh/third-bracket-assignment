# Tasks: Task Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-task-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as TaskFlow Constitution requires Test-Driven Development approach

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths shown below assume web application structure from plan.md

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are organized by user story with TDD approach.
  TaskFlow Constitution requires Test-Driven Development with 80%+ coverage.

  Each user story can be implemented and tested independently:
  - Tests written first (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
  - Models/Services implemented to pass tests
  - Components/UI built to integrate with backend
  - Each story delivers complete, independently testable functionality
  ============================================================================

  MVP Strategy: User Story 1 (Authentication) can be delivered as standalone MVP
  Incremental delivery: Add User Story 2 ‚Üí User Story 3 for full functionality
-->

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (US1): Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (US2): Depends on US1 for user authentication context
  - User Story 3 (US3): Depends on US2 for task data to organize
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Foundation for all other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Uses authentication context and requires user sessions
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 2 - Organizes and displays data created in US2

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Models before controllers before routes/components
- Backend implementation before frontend integration
- Core functionality before UI polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Tests within each user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Backend and frontend tasks within same story can be parallelized
- Different components within same story can be worked on in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for User model validation in backend/tests/unit/models/user.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for auth registration endpoint in backend/tests/integration/auth.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for auth login endpoint in backend/tests/integration/auth.test.ts"
Task: "Component test for Login component in frontend/src/components/__tests__/Login.test.tsx"
Task: "Component test for Register component in frontend/src/components/__tests__/Register.test.tsx"

# Launch backend components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement auth registration controller in backend/controllers/authController.ts"
Task: "Implement auth login controller in backend/controllers/authController.ts"
Task: "Create auth routes in backend/routes/auth.ts"

# Launch frontend components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Register component in frontend/src/components/Auth/Register.tsx"
Task: "Create Login component in frontend/src/components/Auth/Login.tsx"
Task: "Create PrivateRoute component in frontend/src/components/Layout/PrivateRoute.tsx"
Task: "Create Navbar component with authentication state in frontend/src/components/Layout/Navbar.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready (secure authentication system)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (backend auth)
   - Developer B: User Story 1 (frontend auth components)
   - Developer C: User Story 1 (testing)
3. After User Story 1 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (backend task CRUD)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (frontend task components)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (organization features)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Quality Gates

### Testing Requirements (TDD Approach)
- All tests written before implementation code
- Tests must fail initially (Red phase)
- Implementation makes tests pass (Green phase)
- Refactor while keeping tests green (Refactor phase)
- Minimum 80% code coverage required by TaskFlow Constitution

### Constitution Compliance
- All principles from TaskFlow Constitution must be followed
- Authentication-First Security implemented
- RESTful API Design followed
- Component-Based Frontend Architecture maintained
- Data-Driven Architecture with MongoDB enforced

### Performance Targets
- API response times under 200ms
- Search/filter under 1 second for 1000 tasks
- Registration under 2 minutes, login under 30 seconds
- 95% success rate for task operations

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow TaskFlow Constitution principles throughout implementation
