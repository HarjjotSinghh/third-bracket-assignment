# Feature Specification: Task Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-task-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Task Management System with user authentication and task tracking capabilities"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1)

New users can register for an account and existing users can securely log in to access their personal task management workspace. Users must be authenticated before accessing any task-related features.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for data security and personalization. Without it, users cannot have private, secure access to their tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by user registration and login flow verification, delivering secure access to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new visitor on the landing page, **When** they click "Register" and provide valid name, email, and password, **Then** they receive a confirmation message and are logged into their new account
2. **Given** a registered user on the login page, **When** they enter correct email and password, **Then** they are redirected to their dashboard and can access task features
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they click "Logout", **Then** they are securely logged out and redirected to the landing page
4. **Given** an unauthenticated user trying to access task pages, **When** they attempt to navigate to protected routes, **Then** they are redirected to the login page

### User Story 2 - Task Creation and Management (Priority: P1)

Authenticated users can create, view, edit, and delete their personal tasks with essential details like title, description, priority level, due dates, and current status.

**Why this priority**: Core task management functionality provides the primary value proposition. Users must be able to perform basic CRUD operations on their tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating, editing, and deleting tasks through the user interface, delivering complete task lifecycle management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on their dashboard, **When** they click "Add Task" and fill in task details (title, description, priority, due date), **Then** the new task appears in their task list
2. **Given** a user viewing their task list, **When** they click on a task, **Then** they see all task details and can edit any field
3. **Given** a user editing a task, **When** they change the status and save, **Then** the updated task reflects the new status in the list
4. **Given** a user viewing their tasks, **When** they click "Delete" on a task and confirm, **Then** the task is permanently removed from their list
5. **Given** a user with multiple tasks, **When** they view their task list, **Then** all their tasks are displayed in an organized list/grid view

---

### User Story 3 - Task Organization and Dashboard (Priority: P2)

Users can filter tasks by status and priority, search tasks by title or description, and view a dashboard with task statistics showing total tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, and breakdown by priority.

**Why this priority**: Organization features help users manage growing task lists efficiently, while the dashboard provides at-a-glance insights into productivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by applying filters, performing searches, and viewing dashboard statistics, delivering enhanced task organization capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with multiple tasks, **When** they apply a status filter (e.g., "Completed"), **Then** only tasks with that status are displayed
2. **Given** a user with various priority tasks, **When** they filter by priority level (e.g., "High"), **Then** only high-priority tasks are shown
3. **Given** a user with many tasks, **When** they enter search terms in the search box, **Then** the list updates to show only tasks matching the search in title or description
4. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they navigate to the dashboard, **Then** they see statistics for total tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, and priority breakdown
5. **Given** a user viewing dashboard statistics, **When** they click on any statistic category, **Then** they are navigated to the corresponding filtered task list

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: What should be the user session timeout duration and behavior? → A: 24 hours timeout with 5-minute warning before expiration
- Q: What is the maximum number of tasks allowed per user? → A: 1000 tasks maximum per user
- Q: How should the system handle loading states and error messages? → A: Loading spinners during operations + specific error messages for validation failures, network issues, empty states
- Q: What should be the system uptime target and reliability approach? → A: 99.5% uptime with graceful degradation
- Q: What should be the character limits for task titles and descriptions? → A: Title 200 chars, Description 2000 chars

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users enter invalid email formats during registration?
- How does system handle duplicate email registrations?
- What happens when users try to access task data after session expiration?
- **Session timeout**: Users receive 5-minute warning before automatic logout after 24 hours of inactivity
- How does system behave when task due dates are in the past?
- What happens when users try to delete tasks that are already completed?
- **Character limits**: Task titles limited to 200 characters, descriptions limited to 2000 characters
- What happens when users have no tasks in their list?
- **Error handling**: Loading spinners shown during operations; specific error messages displayed for validation failures, network issues, and empty states
- How does system behave when multiple browser tabs are open with the same account?
