# Research: Task Management System

**Purpose**: Technical research findings for implementation decisions
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: Task Management System

## Authentication & Security

### Decision: JWT with bcrypt
**Rationale**: JWT provides stateless authentication suitable for RESTful APIs, while bcrypt offers industry-standard password hashing. This combination aligns with TaskFlow Constitution requirements and provides excellent security for user sessions.

**Implementation Details**:
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration and 5-minute warning
- bcrypt with salt rounds (10-12 recommended)
- Session management through localStorage on frontend
- Protected route middleware for both frontend and backend

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based authentication (stateful, less suitable for RESTful APIs)
- OAuth2 integration (overkill for simple authentication)

## Database & Data Modeling

### Decision: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
**Rationale**: MongoDB provides flexible schema evolution and excellent performance for read-heavy operations. Mongoose adds schema validation, relationship management, and type safety that align with TaskFlow Constitution requirements.

**Implementation Details**:
- User schema with email uniqueness, password hashing, timestamps
- Task schema with user reference, character limits, priority/status enums
- Indexes on userId, task status, priority for performance
- Connection pooling and error handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL (more rigid schema, excellent for relational data)
- SQLite (not suitable for multi-user web applications)

## Frontend Architecture

### Decision: React with Context API
**Rationale**: React 18+ provides excellent component reusability and performance. Context API handles authentication state without additional libraries, following TaskFlow Constitution requirements for simplicity.

**Implementation Details**:
- Functional components with hooks
- Context API for authentication state
- React Router for navigation and protected routes
- Responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Loading states and error handling per component

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux/Zustand (overkill for this application size)
- Vue.js (excellent alternative but React specified in constitution)

## API Design

### Decision: RESTful API with Express.js
**Rationale**: Express.js provides proven stability and extensive ecosystem. RESTful design ensures predictable client-server communication and aligns with TaskFlow Constitution requirements.

**Implementation Details**:
- Resource-oriented endpoints (/api/auth, /api/tasks)
- Consistent error response format
- express-validator for input validation
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- Rate limiting and security headers

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL (overkill for this application complexity)
- FastAPI (excellent but requires Python, conflicting with constitution)

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Jest-based Testing Stack
**Rationale**: Jest provides comprehensive testing capabilities with good performance and ecosystem support. Covers unit, integration, and frontend component testing per TaskFlow Constitution requirements.

**Implementation Details**:
- Jest for unit tests (backend controllers, models, utilities)
- Supertest for API integration tests
- React Testing Library for component testing
- 80%+ code coverage requirement
- Test database for isolated testing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mocha/Chai (solid alternative but Jest more comprehensive)
- Cypress (excellent for E2E but heavier than needed)

## Performance & Scalability

### Decision: Optimized for 1000 tasks per user
**Rationale**: Based on specification requirements, implement performance optimizations that scale to 1000 tasks per user with <1s search/filter response times.

**Implementation Details**:
- Database indexes on userId, status, priority, title
- Pagination for large task lists
- Debounced search input
- Efficient filtering with MongoDB aggregation
- Performance monitoring and alerting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full-text search engines (overkill for current requirements)
- Real-time updates (not specified in requirements)

## Error Handling & UX

### Decision: Comprehensive Error States
**Rationale**: Based on clarification requirements, implement loading spinners and specific error messages for all user interactions.

**Implementation Details**:
- Loading states for all async operations
- Specific error messages for validation failures
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms
- Empty state handling for no tasks scenarios
- Toast notifications for user feedback

**Deployment Considerations**

### Environment Configuration
- Environment variables for all configuration
- .env.example with documentation
- Separate development/staging/production configs
- Secure secret management for JWT keys

### Monitoring & Reliability
- Structured logging for debugging
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful degradation for 99.5% uptime target
- Error tracking and alerting

## Research Summary

All technical decisions align with TaskFlow Constitution requirements and specification clarifications. The chosen technology stack (Node.js/Express/MongoDB/React) provides a solid foundation for the Task Management System with excellent security, performance, and maintainability characteristics.
