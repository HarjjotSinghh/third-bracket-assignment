# TaskFlow Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Authentication-First Security
All application features MUST be protected by robust authentication and authorization. JWT tokens MUST be used for session management, with password hashing via bcrypt. Protected routes MUST validate authentication on both frontend and backend. Security is non-negotiable - no feature should compromise user data protection.

### II. RESTful API Design
All backend functionality MUST expose clean RESTful endpoints following HTTP standards. Input validation MUST be implemented using express-validator. Error responses MUST be consistent and properly formatted. API endpoints MUST be stateless and follow resource-oriented design patterns. Frontend MUST communicate exclusively through these APIs.

### III. Test-Driven Development (TDD) - NON-NEGOTIABLE
Tests MUST be written before implementation code. Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. All tests MUST fail initially, then implementation should make them pass. Unit tests for individual components, integration tests for API endpoints, and end-to-end tests for user workflows are mandatory.

### IV. Component-Based Frontend Architecture
Frontend MUST be built using React with reusable components. State management MUST use React Context API for authentication. Components MUST be independently testable and follow single responsibility principle. Responsive design is mandatory for mobile compatibility. Loading states and error handling MUST be implemented in all components.

### V. Data-Driven Architecture with MongoDB
All data persistence MUST use MongoDB with proper schema definitions. Database indexes MUST be created for performance optimization. Data models MUST enforce required fields and validation rules. Mongoose SHOULD be used as the ODM for schema validation and relationship management.

## Technical Requirements & Standards

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Frontend**: React with React Router for navigation
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Validation**: express-validator for input validation
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API testing

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint and Prettier MUST be configured for consistent code formatting
- All functions MUST have proper error handling
- Logging MUST be implemented for debugging and monitoring
- CORS MUST be properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- Environment variables MUST be used for configuration management

### Performance Requirements
- API response time MUST be under 200ms for database operations
- Frontend MUST implement loading states for async operations
- Database queries MUST use appropriate indexes
- Images and assets MUST be optimized for web delivery

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

### Git Workflow Requirements
- All changes MUST be made on feature branches
- Pull requests MUST pass all automated tests before merge
- Code MUST be reviewed by at least one team member
- Commit messages MUST follow conventional commit format

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage MUST be above 80%
- All API endpoints MUST have integration tests
- User authentication flows MUST be fully tested
- Database operations MUST be tested with test database

### Deployment Standards
- Environment variables MUST be documented in .env.example
- Production deployments MUST use secure environment configuration
- Database migrations MUST be versioned and reversible
- Rollback procedures MUST be documented and tested

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and migration plan. All code reviews and pull requests must verify compliance with these principles. Complex solutions that violate simplicity principles must be justified with clear business value. Use this constitution as the foundation for all technical decisions and development practices.
